 Prototype assets for the roguelike game Feastiary

This is a game concept that I've had since 2023. A top-down turn-based tactical roguelike where the player battles and eats food monsters while gaining powerful spells and Calories to cast them.
More information on mechanics, characters, monsters, and world are in the Obsidian document folder.
