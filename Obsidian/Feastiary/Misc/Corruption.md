Not much is known about Corruption, only that it is theorized to be what causes inanimate objects like food and appliances to suddenly become alive and attack everything on sight. Monsters seem to congregate around random "hotspots" across the world, but the unpredictable nature of which makes it difficult for people to understand or work around such problems. It's seemingly as random as the weather, one day you can prepare a delicious soup and another day that same soup will launch a delicious fire ball at your house. This has caused superstitions across many settlements as to what is "safe" to prepare, or where cooking should be done, or what food should be grown. It is also believed that Corruption contributes to food monsters being largely inedible and cause regular people to get sick unless prepared in a very specific manner.
