A salvaged pistol. Costs zero calories to fire and is extremely effective against certain monsters, but don't expect to find more ammo.

However, by imbuing some [[Elemental Magic]], a gun can be used as a focus to launch magical projectiles with damage comparable to full spells. The weapon however lacks utility and offers no other functions besides firing straight in cardinal directions.
