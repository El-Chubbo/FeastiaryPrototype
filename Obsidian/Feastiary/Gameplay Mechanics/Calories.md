The in-universe equivalent to mana. All living things contain calories, burn calories to survive, and seek more calories as part of the never-ending cycle of life. Food monsters overflow with calories, too many for regular people to even properly digest. Anyone who is not a Foodie would get sick attempting to eat a food monster that isn't properly prepared as a meal.

As a gameplay mechanic, calories are resource that allow the player to perform special actions like casting [[Elemental Magic]]. Each turn the player can choose to expend calories if they have the required amount, though there are weaker calorie-free actions should the player be short. To acquire more calories, food monsters drop [[Leftovers]] that must be picked up, or deal the final blow to a monster with [[Feasting]].
