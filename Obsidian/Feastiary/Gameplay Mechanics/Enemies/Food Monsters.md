Hostile creatures that... look like cooked or raw foods that humans would make? Food monsters can vary wildly in appearance and ingredients, but none of them organically live in the ecosystems that they inhabit. They have very few traits animals would have, such as not having diets, mating rituals, ideal habitats, or even natural predators. Food monsters are innately more magical than normal living beings, resulting in their large calorie amount and size.
