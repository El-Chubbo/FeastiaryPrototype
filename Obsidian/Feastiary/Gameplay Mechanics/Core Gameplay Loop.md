Feastiary is a turn-based tactical roguelike where the player navigates through random [[Zones]] with varying food monster and boss encounters. Along the way the player will gain [[Calories]] through eating monsters and other means to cast spells and gradually gain [[FAT]]. FAT operates as an EXP system that increases the player's power over time.

As the player clears encounters, they will gain access to new abilities through weapons, perks, and most importantly new spells.
